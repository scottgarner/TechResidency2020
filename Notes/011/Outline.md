## New Directions

***

### Paused "Creature" Explorations
* Felt very prescriptive.
* Was becoming very screen-focused with multiple steps.
* Could potentially work with "smart" objects.

***

### Symmetrical Drawing Experiences

* Symmetry focused stream.
* Drawing activity with the 8th graders.

* Lacey is helping expand the drawing activity.

***

### Arrangements of Physical Objects

* Visitors arrange objects and the software builds radial patterns.
* Could have multiple sets of items.
* Photography and computer vision issues.
* Too much like a broken kaleidoscope?

***

### Hardware Research

* Looking Glass is magical, but pretty low fidelity.
* Leap Motion input is fun, but finicky?
* These may be best suited for another project.
* Round display options are pretty limited.
    * Projection vs. low resolution vs. expensive.

## Current High-Level Ideas

***

 ### Creature creator.
* Multi-step, screen-based process.
* Smart object-based process.
* All creatures share an environment.

***

 ### Radial drawing activity.
* Shared drawing experience.
* Individual radial drawing activity + combined drawings.
* Could be touch-based or used dials or other input.

***

 ### Object arrangement activity.
* Two-step camera-based.
* Designs could share an environment.
