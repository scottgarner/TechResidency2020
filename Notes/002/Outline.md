# Getting Started In Creative Tech

***

## Our Focus Today

Building on our Tuesday discussion, I'll talk about some tools and devices that can make it easier to get started working with technology in creative ways.

***

## High-Level Overview

* Design and production practices are still part of the process.
* We very rarely start totally from scratch with hardware or software.
* There are a huge range of software and hardware platforms and tools to build on.

***

## The Learning Process
* Tinkering and problem-solving are essential.

***

## Pieces of the Puzzle

* Creative software development.
* Creative hardware development.
* Making it all talk.

***

### Creative Software Development

* Writing code to draw images, create sounds and more.
* Processing and p5.js are great for beginners.
* Unity3D is popular, powerful and supports a lot of platforms.
* Many other tools and libraries that can take care of a wide array of tasks.
* Programming isn't just about languages.

### Creative Hardware Development

* Use sensors, indicators and actuators to interface with the outside world.
* Arduino is an amazing platform to build on.
* Raspberry PI is interesting, but fairly complicated.
* You can build custom digital or analog circuits to do many interesting things.

### Where To Start?

* There are many kits and ecosystems, but...
* Processing + Arduino is a winning combination.
* Dan Schiffman tutorials are amazing.
