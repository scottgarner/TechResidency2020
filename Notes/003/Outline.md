# Residency Check-in

***

## Themes and Goals

* Isolated interconnectedness.
* Collaboration between a user and a generative system.
* Artwork in which every user permanently changes the piece by interacting with it.
* Physical gesture as a bridge to visual art.

***

## Mood Reference

* Celestial, molecular, particular, organic.
* [Pinterest Board](https://www.pinterest.com/scottmadethis/cmop-residency/)
* Playlist is in progress.

***

## Visitor Interaction

* Visitors use their body movements to control the system.
* Every visitor leaves a digital artifact that permanently changes the exhibit.
* Either full-body gestural movements, or intricate hand/finger movements. (Maybe both?)
* Movements &raquo; Generative Forms &raquo; Generative Music

***

## Component Footprint

* Free-standing and on casters to be repositioned.
* Will use either a short throw project or a triptych of 3-4 large displays.
* Interactive sensor will be on a stand in front of the displays.
* Process and technical info will be displayed on a screen on the back/side.

# Hardware

* [Azure Kinect DK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kinect-dk/)
    * [VFK Unity Library](https://github.com/keijiro/Akvfx)
    * [Body Tracking SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/Kinect-dk/body-sdk-setup)

## Experiments So Far

* [Realtime motion tracking from a cell phone.](https://mobile-dancer.glitch.me/)
* [Sphere study with procedural animation.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8Z-zfAEHC/)
* Various other on-stream experiments.

***

## Remote Interaction?

* Motion data from cell phones sent over the web.
* VR could be another possibility with the same codebase.

***

## Concerns Section

* Remote interaction has a lot of issues and limitations.
* Very screen focused.
* Where does it live in MuseumLab?
