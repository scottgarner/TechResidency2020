## Topics

* The Process
* Materials and Fabrication

***

## The Process

* Concept development: Big ideas within constraints.
* Design phase: Sketches, models, drawings, etc.
* Prototyping phase: Experimenting with approaches.
* Final fabrication phase: Build it!
* Documentation: Easy to forget, but so important!

### Materials and Fabrication
 * Traditional construction materials: Wood, metal, plastic, concrete, etc.
 * Traditional craft materials: Paper, fabrics, glass, ceramic, etc.
 * Off-the-shelf parts: Screws, bolts, connectors, etc.
 * Fabrication methods are often dictated by the materials.
 * Digital fabrication leverages computers to help with the work.
